# Date Translator
Using Neural Machine Translation with Attention to build a date translator react component

This project is a proof of concept about How to build Frontend Components powered by Deep Learning. I used it in a presentation, which slides can be found [here](https://slides.com/jscriptcoder/frontend-components)

See [Jupyter notebook (html format)](https://jscriptcoder.github.io/date-translator/Machine%20Translation%20with%20Attention%20model.html) for information about this project and how the model has been built and trained.
